# Development

*Basic core Programmes **used Python***
# In ReplaceString.py
    * used the regex part for valid User entry
    * output Print the String with UserName

## CoinFlips.py
    * used fuctions and random function to get heads and tails
    * output percentage of heads & tails

### LeapYear.py
    * Checking the LeapYear
    * Used functions

#### PowerTable.py
    * This program takes a command-line argument N and prints a table of the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^N
    * I/P -> The Power Value N. Only works if 0 <= N < 31 since 2^31 overflows an int
    * Logic -> repeat until i equals N

##### HarmonicNumber.py
    * Desc -> Prints the Nth harmonic number: 1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/N
    * I/P -> The Harmonic Value N.
    * O/P -> Print the Nth Harmonic Value

###### Factors.py
    * Desc -> Computes the prime factorization of N using brute force
    * I/P -> Number to find the prime factors
    * Logic -> Traverse till i*i <= N instead of i <= N for efficiency
    * O/P -> Print the prime factors of number N
